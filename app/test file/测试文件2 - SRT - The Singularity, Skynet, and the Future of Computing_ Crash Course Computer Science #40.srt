1
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,040
Hi, I’m Carrie Anne, and welcome to Crash Course Computer Science!

2
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:08,219
We’re here: the final episode!

3
00:00:08,219 --> 00:00:12,080
If you’ve watched the whole series, hopefully you’ve developed a newfound appreciation

4
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,700
for the incredible breadth of computing applications and topics.

5
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:18,410
It’s hard to believe we’ve worked up from mere transistors and logic gates, all the

6
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:21,460
way to computer vision, machine learning, robotics and beyond.

7
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:25,750
We’ve stood on the shoulders of giants like Babbage and Lovelace, Hollerith and Turing,

8
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:30,770
Eckert and Hopper, Sutherland and Engelbart, Bush and Berners Lee, Gates and the Woz, and

9
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:32,739
many other computing pioneers.

10
00:00:32,739 --> 00:00:36,080
My biggest hope is that these episodes have inspired you to learn more about how these

11
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:37,540
subjects affect your life.

12
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:41,100
Maybe you’ll even pick up programming or choose a career in computing.

13
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:42,100
It’s awesome!

14
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:43,840
It’s also a skill of the future.

15
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:48,140
I said in the very first episode that computer science isn’t magic, but it sort of is!

16
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:52,120
Knowing how to use and program computers is sorcery of the 21st century.

17
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:55,400
Instead of incantations and spells, it’s scripts and code.

18
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:59,380
Those who know how to wield that tremendous power will be able to craft great things,

19
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:03,620
not just to improve their own lives, but also their communities and humanity at large.

20
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:08,480
Computing is also going to be literally everywhere – not just the computers we see today, sitting

21
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:13,780
on desks and countertops, and carried in pockets and bags – but inside every object imaginable.

22
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:18,990
Inside all your kitchen appliances, embedded in your walls, nanotagged in your food, woven

23
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:21,940
into your clothes, and floating around inside your body.

24
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:24,440
This is the vision of the field of Ubiquitous Computing.

25
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:28,500
In some ways, it’s already here, and in other ways, we’ve got many decades to go.

26
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:33,170
Some might view this eventuality as dystopian, with computers everywhere surveilling us and

27
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:34,960
competing for our attention.

28
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:39,360
But the late Mark Weiser, who articulated this idea in the 1990s, saw the potential

29
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,360
very differently:

30
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:44,340
“For [fifty] years, most interface design, and most computer design, has been headed

31
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:46,580
down the path of the &quot;dramatic&quot; machine.

32
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:51,710
Its highest idea is to make a computer so exciting, so wonderful, so interesting, that

33
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:53,310
we never want to be without it.

34
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:58,420
A less-traveled path I call the &quot;invisible&quot;; its highest idea is to make a computer so

35
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:03,530
imbedded, so fitting, so natural, that we use it without even thinking about it …

36
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:06,700
The most profound technologies are those that disappear.

37
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:11,700
They weave themselves into the fabric of everyday life until they are indistinguishable from it.&quot;

38
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:15,360
That doesn’t describe computing of today – where people sit for hours upon end in

39
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,540
front of computer monitors, and social media notifications interrupt us at dinner.

40
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:23,460
But, it could describe computing of the future, our final topic.

41
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:32,420
INTRO

42
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:37,060
When people think of computing in the future, they often jump right to Artificial Intelligence.

43
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:41,290
No doubt there will be tremendous strides made in AI in the coming years, but not everything

44
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:43,930
will be, or need to be, AI-powered.

45
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:48,030
Your car might have an AI to self-drive, but the door locks might continue to be powered

46
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:50,200
by what are essentially if-statements.

47
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:54,880
AI technology is just as likely to enhance existing devices, like cars, as it is to open

48
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,880
up entirely new product categories.

49
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:01,440
The exact same thing happened with the advent of electrical power – lightbulbs replaced candles.

50
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:06,300
But electrification also led to the creation of hundreds of new electrically-powered gadgets.

51
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:08,430
And of course, we still have candles today.

52
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:13,359
It’s most likely that AI will be yet another tool that computer scientists can draw upon

53
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:14,359
to tackle problems.

54
00:03:14,359 --> 00:03:18,650
What really gets people thinking, and sometimes sweating, is whether Artificial Intelligence

55
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:20,709
will surpass human intelligence.

56
00:03:20,709 --> 00:03:24,960
This is a really tricky question for a multitude of reasons, including most immediately:

57
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,240
“what is intelligence?”

58
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:31,400
On one hand, we have computers that can drive cars, recognize songs with only a few seconds of audio,

59
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:36,400
translate dozens of languages, and totally dominate at games like chess, Jeopardy, and Go.

60
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,820
That sounds pretty smart!

61
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:42,280
But on the other hand, computers fail at some basic tasks, like walking up steps, folding

62
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:46,420
laundry, understanding speech at a cocktail party, and feeding themselves.

63
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:51,680
We’re a long way from Artificial Intelligence that’s as general purpose and capable as a human.

64
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:56,100
With intelligence being somewhat hard to quantify, people prefer to characterize computers and

65
00:03:56,100 --> 00:04:01,280
creatures by their processing power instead, but that’s a pretty computing-centric view of intelligence.

66
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,760
Nonetheless, if we do this exercise, plotting computers and processors we’ve talked about

67
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:10,349
in this series, we find that computing today has very roughly equivalence in calculating

68
00:04:10,349 --> 00:04:11,939
power to that of a mouse...

69
00:04:11,939 --> 00:04:16,590
which, to be fair, also can’t fold laundry, although that would be super cute!

70
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:21,919
Human calculating power is up here, another 10 to the 5, or 100,000 times more powerful

71
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:23,210
than computers today.

72
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:27,190
That sounds like a big gap, but with the rate of change in computing technologies, we might

73
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:31,680
meet that point in as early as a decade, even though processor speeds are no longer following

74
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,540
Moore’s Law, like we discussed in Episode 17.

75
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:39,190
If this trend continues, computers would have more processing power, slash intelligence,

76
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:43,780
than the sum total of all human brains combined before the end of this century.

77
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:48,800
And this could snowball as such systems need less human input, with an artificial superintelligence

78
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,229
designing and training new versions of itself.

79
00:04:51,229 --> 00:04:55,280
This runaway technological growth, especially with respect to an intelligence explosion,

80
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,250
is called the singularity.

81
00:04:57,250 --> 00:05:01,860
The term was first used by our old friend from Episode 10, John von Neumann, who said:

82
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:06,460
&quot;The accelerating progress of technology and changes in the mode of human life, give the

83
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:11,380
appearance of approaching some essential singularity in the history of the race beyond which human

84
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:13,740
affairs, as we know them, could not continue.&quot;

85
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:18,260
And Von Neumann suggested this back in the 1950s, when computers were trillions of times

86
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:19,710
slower than they are today.

87
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:24,220
Sixty years later, though, the singularity is still just a possibility on the horizon.

88
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:28,160
Some experts believe this progress is going to level off, and be more of an S curve than

89
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:33,800
an exponential one, where as complexity increases, it becomes more difficult to make additional progress.

90
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:37,220
Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen calls it a “complexity brake”.

91
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:42,050
But, as a thought experiment, let’s just say that superintelligent computers will emerge.

92
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:44,960
What that would mean for humanity is a hotly debated topic.

93
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:49,700
There are people who eagerly await it, and those who are already working to stop it from happening.

94
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:53,820
Probably the most immediate effect would be technological unemployment, where workers

95
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:58,479
in many job sectors are rendered obsolete by computers – like AIs and Robots – that

96
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:00,870
can do their work better and for less pay.

97
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:03,520
Although computers are new, this effect is not.

98
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,840
Remember Jacquard's Loom from Episode 10?

99
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:11,020
That automated the task of skilled textile workers back in the 1800s, which led to riots.

100
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:14,800
Also, back then, most of the population of the US and Europe were farmers.

101
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:20,069
That’s dropped to under 5% today, due to advances like synthetic fertilizers and tractors.

102
00:06:20,069 --> 00:06:24,720
More modern examples include telephone switchboard operators being replaced with automatic switchboards

103
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:29,940
in 1960, and robotic arms replacing human painters in car factories in the 1980s.

104
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:31,471
And the list goes on and on.

105
00:06:31,471 --> 00:06:34,409
On one hand, these were jobs lost to automation.

106
00:06:34,409 --> 00:06:39,340
And on the other hand, clothes, food, bicycles, toys, and a myriad of other products are all

107
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:43,480
plentiful today because they can be cheaply produced thanks to computing.

108
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:48,960
But, experts argue that AI, robots and computing technologies in general, are going to be even

109
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,389
more disruptive than these historical examples.

110
00:06:51,389 --> 00:06:55,010
Jobs, at a very high level, can be summarized along two dimensions.

111
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:59,340
First, jobs can be either more manual – like assembling toys – or more cognitive – like

112
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:00,580
picking stocks.

113
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:05,850
These jobs can also be routine – the same tasks over and over again – or non-routine

114
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:09,780
– where tasks vary and workers need to problem solve and be creative.

115
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:12,969
We already know that routine-manual jobs can be automated by machines.

116
00:07:12,969 --> 00:07:16,669
It has already happened for some jobs and is happening right now for others.

117
00:07:16,669 --> 00:07:21,100
What’s getting people worried is that non-routine manual jobs, like cooks, waiters and security

118
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:23,189
guards, may get automated too.

119
00:07:23,189 --> 00:07:27,699
And the same goes for routine cognitive work, like customer service agents, cashiers, bank

120
00:07:27,699 --> 00:07:29,419
tellers, and office assistants.

121
00:07:29,419 --> 00:07:33,199
That leaves us with just one quadrant that might be safe, at least for a little while:

122
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:37,900
non-routine cognitive work, which includes professions like teachers and artists, novelists

123
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:39,880
and lawyers, and doctors and scientists.

124
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:43,820
These types of jobs encompass roughly 40% of the US workforce.

125
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:47,100
That leaves 60% of jobs vulnerable to automation.

126
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:52,500
People argue that technological unemployment at this scale would be unprecedented and catastrophic,

127
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,260
with most people losing their jobs.

128
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:58,509
Others argue that this will be great, freeing people from less interesting jobs to pursue

129
00:07:58,509 --> 00:08:03,479
better ones, all while enjoying a higher standard of living with the bounty of food and products

130
00:08:03,479 --> 00:08:06,720
that will result from computers and robots doing most of the hard work.

131
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,420
No one really knows how this is going to shake out, but if history is any guide, it’ll

132
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:12,220
probably be ok in the long run.

133
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:16,880
Afterall, no one is advocating that 90% of people go back to farming and weaving textiles

134
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:17,560
by hand.

135
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:22,080
The tough question, which politicians are now discussing, is how to handle hopefully-short-term

136
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:26,040
economic disruption, for millions of people that might be suddenly out of a job.

137
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:29,920
Beyond the workplace, computers are also very likely to change our bodies.

138
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:35,349
For example, futurist Ray Kurzweil believes that “The Singularity will allow us to transcend

139
00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:38,469
[the] limitations of our biological bodies and brains.

140
00:08:38,469 --> 00:08:40,219
We will gain power over our fates.

141
00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:42,709
... We will be able to live as long as we want.

142
00:08:42,709 --> 00:08:47,370
We will fully understand human thinking and will vastly extend and expand its reach.”

143
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:52,130
Transhumanists see this happening in the form of cyborgs, where humans and technology merge,

144
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:54,200
enhancing our intellect and physiology.

145
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,470
There are already brain computer interfaces in use today.

146
00:08:57,470 --> 00:09:01,690
And wearable computers, like Google Glass and Microsoft Hololens, are starting to blur

147
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:02,440
the line too.

148
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:06,960
There are also people who foresee &quot;Digital Ascension&quot;, which, in the words of Jaron Lanier,

149
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:12,600
“would involve people dying in the flesh and being uploaded into a computer and remaining conscious&quot;.

150
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:18,080
This transition from biological to digital beings might end up being our next evolutionary step...

151
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:26,800
and a new level of abstraction.

152
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:31,520
Others predict humans staying largely human, but with superintelligent computers as a benevolent

153
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:36,740
force, emerging as a caretaker for humanity – running all the farms, curing diseases,

154
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:41,160
directing robots to pick-up trash, building new homes and many other functions.

155
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:45,060
This would allow us to simply enjoy our time on this lovely pale blue dot.

156
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:49,940
Still others view AI with more suspicion – why would a superintelligent AI waste its time

157
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:51,300
taking care of us?

158
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:55,200
It’s not like we’ve taken on the role of being the benevolent caretaker of ants.

159
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:59,860
So maybe this play out like so many Sci-Fi movies where we’re at war with computers,

160
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:01,829
our own creation having turned on us.

161
00:10:01,829 --> 00:10:05,420
It’s impossible to know what the future holds, but it’s great that this discussion

162
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:10,720
and debate is already happening, so as these technologies emerge, we can plan and react intelligently.

163
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:15,100
What’s much more likely, regardless of whether you see computers as future friend or foe,

164
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:17,240
is that they will outlive humanity.

165
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:21,140
Many futurists and science fiction writers have speculated that computers will head out

166
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:26,120
into space and colonize the galaxy, ambivalent to time scales, radiation, and all that other

167
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:29,440
stuff that makes long-distance space travel difficult for us humans.

168
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:34,120
And when the sun is burned up and the Earth is space dust, maybe our technological children

169
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:38,160
will be hard at work exploring every nook and cranny of the universe, hopefully in honor

170
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:43,170
of their parents’ tradition to build knowledge,improve the state of the universe, and to boldly go

171
00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:44,970
where no one has gone before!

172
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:48,720
In the meantime, computers have a long way to go, and computer scientists are hard at

173
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,980
work advancing all of the topics we talked about over the past forty episodes.

174
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:57,940
In the next decade or so, we’ll likely see technologies like virtual and augmented reality,

175
00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:02,820
self-driving vehicles, drones, wearable computers, and service robots go mainstream.

176
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:08,700
The internet will continue to evolve new services, stream new media, and connect people in different ways.

177
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:13,010
New programming languages and paradigms will be developed to facilitate the creation of

178
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:14,780
new and amazing software.

179
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:20,800
And new hardware will make complex operations blazingly fast, like neural networks and 3D graphics.

180
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:25,510
Personal computers are also ripe for innovation, perhaps shedding their forty-year old desktop

181
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:30,160
metaphor and being reborn as omnipresent and lifelong virtual assistants.

182
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:34,320
And there’s so much we didn’t get to talk about in this series, like cryptocurrencies,

183
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:39,140
wireless communication, 3D printing, bioinformatics, and quantum computing.

184
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:44,240
We’re in a golden age of computing and there’s so much going on, it’s impossible to summarize.

185
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:49,070
But most importantly, you can be a part of this amazing transformation and challenge,

186
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:53,700
by learning about computing, and taking what’s arguably humanity’s greatest invention,

187
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:55,760
to make the world a better place.

188
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:55,765
Thanks for watching.
